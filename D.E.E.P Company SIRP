# Preparation
Team Formation: Assemble an Incident Response Team (IRT) with roles and responsibilities clearly defined. This team should include members from IT, security, legal, HR, and public relations.
Tools and Resources: Ensure the team has access to necessary tools and resources, including forensic tools, communication tools, and access to critical systems.
Training and Awareness: Regular training sessions for the IRT and general staff awareness programs are crucial for preparing for potential incidents.
# Identification
Detection Mechanisms: Utilize intrusion detection systems, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and regular audits to monitor for anomalies.
Incident Logging: Document all suspected incidents, including the time of detection, who detected it, and any initial findings.
# Containment
Short-term Containment: Isolate the affected system(s) to prevent further damage. This may involve disconnecting the systems from the network or shutting them down.
Long-term Containment: Implement measures to securely restore operations, such as moving systems to a clean environment or applying additional security controls.
# Eradication
Root Cause Analysis: Determine how the incident occurred and the extent of the damage. This involves thorough investigation and may require forensic analysis.
Removal of Threats: Ensure that all aspects of the threat are removed from the environment. This could involve deleting malicious files, removing unauthorized user accounts, or updating security patches.
# Recovery
System Restoration: Restore systems from backups after ensuring they are clean and secure.
Service and Data Restoration: Gradually restore services to normal operations, ensuring they are not compromised.
Monitoring: Implement enhanced monitoring to detect any signs of recurrence.
# Lessons Learned
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a meeting with the IRT and other stakeholders to discuss what happened, how it was handled, and what could be improved.
Update Plan: Revise the security incident response plan based on lessons learned and feedback from the team.
Continuous Improvement: Security is an ongoing process. Regularly update security measures, tools, and team training based on evolving threats.
# Additional Considerations
Communication Plan: Have a clear communication strategy for internal stakeholders and external parties (such as customers or partners). This includes predefined templates for notifications.
Compliance and Legal Requirements: Ensure the plan aligns with legal and regulatory requirements, considering data breach notification laws and industry-specific regulations.
Integration with Business Continuity: Ensure the SIRP is integrated with the organization's business continuity plan (BCP) for a cohesive response to incidents that may impact business operations.
